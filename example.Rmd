In contrast to Rstudio, the setup chunk is not run automatically:
```{r setup}
library("languageserver")
library("httpgd")
library("devtools")
```


These paths should point to the conda environment:
```{r}
R.home()
system("source ~/.bashrc; which R", intern = TRUE)
.libPaths()
```

Plotting:
```{r}
boxplot(mpg ~ carb, mtcars)
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
